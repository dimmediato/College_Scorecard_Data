## Texas P Values

These are the tests done for the various graphs for the Texas case study. They include: t-tests for differences between means, and Chi-squared tests to test whether the column variables are "significantly associated" with each other. 

```{r cars}
Texas = read.csv("Texas_retention.csv")
t.test(Overall.GPA ~ Retention, data = Texas)
t.test(High.School.GPA ~ Retention, data = Texas)
chisq.test(table(Texas$Change.in.GPA,Texas$Retention))
chisq.test(table(Texas$Received.Financial.Aid,Texas$Retention))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
