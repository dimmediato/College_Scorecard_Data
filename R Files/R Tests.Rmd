## Texas P Values

These are the tests done for the various graphs for the Texas case study. They include: t-tests for differences between means, and Chi-squared tests to test whether the column variables are "significantly associated" with each other. 

```{r Texas}
Texas = read.csv("Texas_retention.csv")
t.test(Overall.GPA ~ Retention, data = Texas)
#mean in group Not retained     mean in group Retained 
                  #3.023611                   3.113918 #p-value < 2.2e-16
t.test(High.School.GPA ~ Retention, data = Texas)
#mean in group Not retained     mean in group Retained 
                  #3.340696                   3.338728 #p-value = 0.8433
chisq.test(table(Texas$Change.in.GPA,Texas$Retention))
#p-value = 0.2266
chisq.test(table(Texas$Received.Financial.Aid,Texas$Retention))
#p-value = 3.376e-05
